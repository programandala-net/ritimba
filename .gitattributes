# 2017-09-17: Unfortunately, GitHub does not recognize the BASIC
# language, only a few dialects with their specific filename
# extensions; even worst, the generic .bas, used by many BASIC
# dialects, is taken by Visual Basic! Therefore the override here is
# useless:

# SBASIC sources:
*.bas linguist-language=BASIC
*_bas linguist-generated
*_bas linguist-language=BASIC
*_sbim linguist-language=BASIC

# S*BASIC extensions:
*_code binary
target/ext/* linguist-vendored

# Pictures
*_scr binary
*_bmp binary
*.bmp binary

# Sounds:
*.ub binary
*.ub linguist-vendored

# Fonts:
*_font binary
*_font linguist-vendored

# SMSQmulator:
target/SMSQ* linguist-vendored
target/lib/* linguist-vendored
target/SMSQmulator.ini linguist-vendored=false

# vim: filetype=config
