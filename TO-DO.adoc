== 2017-09-22

- Rename `pc%`.
- Move the data from `issue_data$()` into numeric arrays.
- Improve `center_for%` and `center`: calculate the actual size of the
  text using the current `csize`.

== 2017-10-08

- Improve `center`: use a backslash to mark the prefered split points
  in the text.
- Improve design of the treasury report.
- Display something during the calculation of the possible allies.

== 2017-10-09

- Improve wording of "sus tierras". Better yet: Add an additional
  wording to be used in the advice report.

== 2017-10-11

  ZX Spectrum border. Then the output window can use its own internal
  border as a margin.
- Extend the description of events.
- Improve the police report: Mark groups with low popularity and
  enough power.
- Improve the title of the splash screen.

- Improve the choosing of the loyal group. Improve the numbering of
  the list and the prompt. Count the loyal groups in advance.

  combine with advice report and adapt the valid options if the
  decision is not affordable.

- Rewrite the final text of the score report.
- Fix: Clear the input window before the escape to Leftoto.

- Add option: Escape.

== 2017-10-14

- Improve design of `ask_for_loan`.

== 2017-10-15
